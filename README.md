Midterm Project
Quake Soccer Ball
The soccer balls are created as mutants that are spawned by players using grenades.
Each player starts off with two different blasters, one is for pushing or kicking the soccer ball, which works against other players
The other is to spawn a goal post. If a mutant touches a goal post or is pushed into one, the mutant or soccer ball dies.
Player has double jump ability
Power ups include the armor shard which gives the player 1000 ammo of everything
The shotgun shoots one barrel, super shotgun shoots 5 barrels and the rocket launcher shoots 20 rockets

A scoring system was not implemented to give frag points to the player responsible for pushing the mutant
